# Custom Git Command I Use All The Time!

> Using Git Aliases To Simplify Saving Your Changes

[Makes Git 1.47x Times Nicer!](thumb.png)

Git is awesome, but Git can be cumbersome as well. It seems like Git developers are well aware of that problem; that's why they introduced a feature called Git Aliases. In this article, I'm going to introduce you to Git Aliases and guide you on how to create the one I use virtually every day!

> If you just want a quick script for adding the command, jump straight to the [TLDR](#tldr) at the end of this article.

## What is Git Alias?

Git Aliases are a way to extend the `git` command line utils with new commands, perhaps giving an old command a shorter or clearer name. For example, we can create a one-word alias for the command showing us the information about the last commit:

```sh
git config --global alias.last 'log -1 HEAD'
```

Immediately after setting the alias, you will be able to use it as a git command:

```sh
git last
```

Getting in response something like this:

```text
commit 297625e0522f5488f7f923d6a1ece4c4f8ebdab8 (HEAD -> git-save-assets, origin/git-save-assets)
Author: Egor Tarasov <vosarat1995@google.com>
Date:   Thu May 15 22:05:48 2025 +0300

    git save article
```

From a technical perspective, the alias setup updated the `~/.gitconfig` file, adding a row to the `alias` section, like this:

```toml
[alias]
	last = log -1 HEAD
```

As you see, using git aliases, you can do what the name suggests: create a shorthand for a certain Git command you use frequently. However, to get the most out of them, we'll need to go slightly beyond that.

## Unlocking Full Git Aliases Potential with ! operator

Let's imagine a situation where you need to perform a git operation, but also need to use a non-git command in a process. This is where the true power of git aliases comes into play. Starting your alias with the `!` operator, you can call commands that do not belong to Git. Let's see this in action:

```sh
git config --global alias.hello '!echo "Hello From Git Alias"'
```

With that in place, you will be able to call `git hello` and get the expected `Hello From Git Alias`.

You can even use shell arguments like this:

```sh
git config --global alias.echo '!echo "from git: $1"'
```

Here's what you will get from calling `git echo one`:

```text
from git: one one
```

Well, it printed what we expected, but for some reason it also duplicated the `one`. This is a peculiar behaviour of git aliases - for some reason, they print the arguments passed after the command output. Gladly, we can work around it by wrapping our script in a function and calling it:

```sh
!f() {

}; f
```

Here's how it will look in our case:

```sh
git config --global alias.echo '!f() {
    echo "from git: $1"
}; f'
```

With the updated setup, running `git echo one` will give us the compact `from git: one`. By the way, wrapping our scripts in functions also helps with complex script constructs like the `if`.

This is enough of the fundamentals. Now, let's jump to building something real!

## Getting Current Branch Name with `current` Alias

Getting the current branch name is a very common task when you are working with git. Of course, you can see it using the `git status` command. Here's an example of what you might see:

```text
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

However, this will print a lot of additional information, which is not suitable, if you want to use it in another script. In this scenario, you should use `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. 

This command seems to be a canonical candidate for a Git alias - it is cumbersome, hard to remember, but does a very common job. Let's call our alias `current`:

```sh
git config --global alias.current 'rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD'
```

Now, running `git current` we should be able to see **just** the current branch name.

We can also now use this alias in another alias. Let's see it in action by printing a nice message utilizing the `git current` and the `!` operator:

```sh
git config --global alias.echo-current '!echo "📌 Current Git Branch: $(git current)"'
```

Here's what we should see from `git echo-current`:

```text
📌 Current Git Branch: main
```

Hurray, we've made a useful Git alias. We'll use it in the next section to build something even cooler.

## Making The Alias. Solving The Verbosity Of Fully Saving Changes 

The next task we are going to simplify with an alias is perhaps the most common git task of all: saving changes. Saving changes normally implies 3 steps:

1. Adding Changes to Git
2. Committing The Changes
3. Pushing the Changes to a remote branch

Let's dissect those steps and see which commands we have for performing all of the steps.

1. Add Changes to Git. By default, `git add` expects the name of the file to be added. However, most of the time, you just want to add everything you have, so we'll use the `--all` flag:

```sh
git add --all
```

2. Commit The Changes. Here we'll just use a verbose version of the command, passing a message passed to the `save` command as a commit message:

```sh
git commit --message "$1"
```

3. Push the Changes. Beyond performing the push, we should also ensure a remote branch exists. Here, our previously created `current` alias comes into play. Combined with the `--set-upstream` argument, it makes sure the local branch is connected to the remote branch with the same name:

```sh
git push --set-upstream origin $(git current)
```

All we have to do is call of the commands above in a single alias. Let's also wrap it in a function to see a proper output. Here's what we might get:

```sh
git config --global alias.save '!f() {
    git add --all
    git commit --message "$1"
    git push --set-upstream origin $(git current)
}; f'
```

After performing the setup, we should be able to save our changes using just `git save "My Changes"`. 

Here's an example output of the command.

```text
[git-save-basic-texts d414d3b] git save basics text

 * [new branch]      git-save-basic-texts -> git-save-basic-texts
branch 'git-save-basic-texts' set up to track 'origin/git-save-basic-texts'.
```

Although we can sort of figure out what has happened by the output, it is quite a challenge. Let's improve the output readability in the next section.

## Improving Transparency with Nice-Shell

To make our alias nicer, let's add some log messages with the commands we are executing and add validation. We'll utilize a [nice-shell](https://github.com/astorDev/nice-shell?tab=readme-ov-file#nice-shell) script for that. First, let's `source` it:

```sh
source /dev/stdin <<< "$(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/nice-shell/refs/heads/main/.sh)"
```

The only thing we'll need to validate is that there was a commit message supplied:

```sh
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    throw "Commit message was not provided"
fi
```

Beyond that, let's log the command we are executing, along with some comments, like this:

```sh
log "Adding all files to git (git add --all)"
```

Here's the complete script:

```sh
source /dev/stdin <<< "$(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/nice-shell/refs/heads/main/.sh)"

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    throw "Commit message was not provided"
fi

log "Adding all files to git (git add --all)"
git add --all

log "Committing changes (git commit --message \"${1}\")"
git commit --message "$1"

log "Pushing changes to the remote repository (git push --set-upstream origin $(git current))"
git push  --set-upstream origin $(git current)

log "Changes have been saved successfully ✅" 
```

Let's now wrap it in a function and pass it to the alias setup.

```sh
git config --global alias.save '!f() { 
    source /dev/stdin <<< "$(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/nice-shell/refs/heads/main/.sh)"

    if [ -z "$1" ]; then
        throw "Commit message was not provided"
    fi

    log "Adding all files to git (git add --all)"
    git add --all

    log "Committing changes (git commit --message \"${1}\")"
    git commit --message "$1"

    log "Pushing changes to the remote repository (git push --set-upstream origin $(git current))"
    git push  --set-upstream origin $(git current)

    log "Changes have been saved successfully ✅" 
}; f'
```

Now, after executing the command below:

```sh
git save "My Changes"
```

You should see `Changes have been saved successfully ✅` printed! 

This wraps up this article. Let's do a quick recap and see a picture of what the result of our command might look like!

## TLDR;

In this article, we've created a git alias called `save`. It allows us to add, commit, and push changes using just one command. Instead of recreating it, you can install it straight from GitHub with this one-liner:

```sh
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/nice-shell/main/git/save/install.sh | sh
```

After you see "✅ Installed the `git save` alias", you will be able to use the alias like this:
