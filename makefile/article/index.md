# Makefile: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples for .NET and Beyond

> Learn `make` util with a practical example of C# project with Docker.

Not that far ago, I've learned about the `make` utility and the `Makefile`. Although that util is very old by computer science standard (1977), it is still extremely helpful today in 2025! In this article, I want to share with you my findings about this utility and give you an example of how to use it with a modern project

The util was originally designed to help with compiling and building C projects, but the way it was built allows it to be useful for roughly any programming language there is. In this article, we will play around with a .NET project and Docker, but I believe you will still be able to grasp an overall idea regardless of the programming language you are using.
